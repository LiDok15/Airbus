This folder contains a solution to the problem of recognition ships using tf.keras for training UNet.

The competition aims to study satellite pictures of container ships and create masks that outline the ships' shapes.

First, we have to download the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbus-ship-detection/data?select=train_ship_segmentations_v2.csv) and store it in the root folder with the following structure
` train_v2
  test_v2
  train_ship_segmentations_v2.csv
  sample_submission_v2.csv`
